django-sms-broker
=================

Dead simple about
-----------------

Integrate easily with any number of SMS service providers (often called
'brokers').

Supported (and customizable) workflow:

1)

                   sms: ABC.HELLO
   USER PHONE    -------------------> MNO (Mobile Network Operator) ------> BROKER

2)

                 notification: ABC.UNICORN
                 from USER PHONE 1234
                 sent to LA 567
     YOUR APP <--------------------- BROKER


3) YOUR APP runs any business logic on the received notification and returns
success or 'I did not manage to fully handle the notification, please send me
another one'.

                   thank you!
     YOUR APP  ---------------------> BROKER

4) Purchase signal and handlers start to process the request and optionally
send something back to the user.

                [SMS/WAPPUSH] http://abc.com?hash to 1234              forward to MNO
     YOUR APP  --------------------------------------------> BROKER --------------------> USER PHONE


5) User activates the mobile link on his device and your application finishes the purchase.

                 [GET] http://abc.com?hash
    YOUR APP <-------------------------------- USER PHONE

Please note that steps 4) and 5) are optional.



How to install
--------------

1. Add 'sms' to INSTALLED_APPS
2. Add 'sms.urls' to your urlconf
3. Perform ./manage.py syncdb
4. Implement ServiceProvider subclass (or inspect the example_provider.py)
5. Configure ServiceProviderData model.
   DummyProvider configuration is shown below:

   >>> ServiceProviderData(slug = 'dummy', name = 'Dummy', module = \
   'sms.DummyProvider').save()

6. Run your application
7. Add '567' Large Account via the admin interface (just for testing purposes).
8. Test notification by navigating to:

/sms/notfication/dummy?origin=1234&text=ABC.UNICORN&destination=567



What's missing
--------------

* LargeAccounts should be optional
* Data fixture for dummy setup
* Improved docs (however, there are some in the source files)
